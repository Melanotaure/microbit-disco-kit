# Controlling the brightness on the 5x5 display

I added this demo which is not really in the Discovery Kit KR-0004.\
But I came across the nrf-led-matrix demo (in C) in ZephyrOS for BBC micro:bit and I wanted to reproduce it in RUST using embassy-nrf and that's done.\
I had a lot of fun trying to reproduce it (with some changes of my own) but finally succeded in it.

Feel free to test it... it's fun!
